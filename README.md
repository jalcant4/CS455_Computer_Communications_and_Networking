# CS455_Computer_Communications_and_Networking
A study in socket programming

1. p1 - Implement a client query to a server
2. p2 - Implement a reliable transport protocol using UDP
3. p3 - Implement a distance vector routing algorithm where the clients interface with a server

# Course Description
This course introduces concepts and design principles of modern computer and
telecommunication networks. It uses the Internet TCP/IP protocol suite to discuss how today’s
computer networks operate and how they have evolved over many years to meet the
requirements of today’s networking applications. The focus will be on both - fundamental
networking and communication techniques, and protocols used in today’s complex Internet
architecture.

Topics include DNS and HTTP protocols at the application layer, TCP and UDP at transport layer,
routing algorithms and forwarding with BGP and OSPF at network layer, and multiple access
technologies along with Ethernet and WiFi LANs. Concepts of network security and related
protocols like the Transport Layer Security (TLS) suite and DNS’ Security Extensions (DNSSEC) will
also be introduced.

# Course Outcomes

1. Understand the architectural principles of computer networking and overall structure of the
Internet
2. Show a clear understanding of layered Internet protocol framework, its design principles and
functionality
3. Explain various network performance metrics (throughput, latency, loss, etc.) and their impact
on applications
4. Describe the essential principles of reliable data delivery, flow control, and congestion control,
and their implementation at transport layer
5. Understand distributed routing protocols, and data and control plane operations of network
layer in Internet
6. Understand wired and wireless data link layer protocols for communication over a shared
medium
7. Demonstrate a basic understanding of network security, vulnerabilities at various layers, and
associated protocols
8. Implement network protocols using network stack programming libraries and use tools such as
Wireshark to analyze real-world networks
